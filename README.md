#FILE_HANDLING_AND_FILE_EXCEPTION

This program demonstrates basic file handling in Python, including creating, reading, appending to and handling errors when working with text files.

#Features

Create and Write: Creates a new file named assignment_week3.txt and writes the text "Hello everyone" to it.

Read: Reads the contents of assignment_week3.txt and prints them to the console.

Append: Adds the text "my Shaila" to the end of the assignment_week3.txt file.

Error Handling: Includes a try-except block to handle a FileNotFoundError, which gracefully informs the user if the specified file does not exist
